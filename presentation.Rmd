## Goal

Create a visual dashboard and integrative analysis platform that provides consistent and robust supporting evidence for use in:

* Prioritization of targets nominated by individual AMP-AD projects.
* Nomination of targets supported across AMP-AD projects.
* Compilation of AMP-AD evidence for use by research community to evaluate other targets of interest.

## Approach

1. Develop prototype.
1. Build alpha platform based on user feedback, focusing on gene-based
queries for nominated AMP-AD targets.
1. Expand to include genes across the genome (partnership with
Josh Shulman @ Baylor).
1. Expand to provide entry points based on gene, protein, network,
or variant queries.

> **Anticipated users:** AMP-AD consortium and affiliates, MODEL-AD consortium, external AD researchers

## Enhancing AMP-AD Project R01

*Increasing resources for target prioritization<br/>within the AMP-AD community*

## User experience interviews

> Understand how our users will interact and utilize the Wall of Targets application - usages, pain points, gaps, and preferences.

> Performed **think aloud exercise** - use the application and state what you are doing and what you are thinking as you use the prototype. 

> 10 participants, including 4 industry/pharma and 3 mouse model system researchers
